# Recipe-Website

This is a test website and the point of making this, is to practice HTML & CSS for Responsive designing.

I uesed a bit JS in this website just for functionality and when I did this, I didn't have much JS knowledge.

The CSS is pure and I didn't use any library like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
